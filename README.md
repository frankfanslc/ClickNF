ClickNF
---------------------
The code published in the repository is partly described in "CliMB: Enabling Network Function Composition with 
Click Middleboxes" paper available at https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2940152 . CliMB provides a full-fledged 
modular TCP layer supporting congestion control, TCP options, both blocking and nonblocking I/O, as well as socket 
and zero-copy APIs to applications. As a result, any TCP network function may now be realized in Click. ClickNF 
extends CliMB in several directions. For instance, ClickNF takes advantage of hardware offloading, multicore 
scalability, timing wheels, and an epoll-based API to improve performance. Finally, L7 modularity and SSL/TLS 
termination provide building blocks for novel network functions to be deployed with little effort.

SETUP
-----------------------

ClickNF uses few external libraries that can be installed separately: 

1) DPDK: ClickNF has its own version of a DPDK module, i.e., different from the one already present in click codebase. ClickNF has been tested with 
   dpdk from version 16.11 up to 18.05. To install and configure DPDK please refer to http://dpdk.org/ 

2) OpenSSL: ClickNF provide a set of modules to interface with OpenSSL. To install it (Debian, Ubuntu) please use 

apt-get install openssl

3) libboost-1.61 context. To install libboost's context library (a coroutine library provided by libboost) please refer to 
http://www.boost.org/ for more details about installation. Make sure libboost_context.so.1.61.0 and libboost_context.so are 
installed in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/

ClickNF automatically uses context library if it is installed (up to libboost-1.61). If context is not installed in the system 
ClickNF uses the slowest coroutine library provided in linux, ucontext. 
Please refer to http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/makecontext.3.html for more details. 

CONFIGURE AND MAKE
-----------------------

To configure ClicNF run this command in its root directory:

./configure --disable-linuxmodule --enable-user-multithread --enable-dpdk --enable-epoll --enable-openssl --enable-batch;

in which:

- --enable-epoll 			 	enables epoll data structure
- --enable-user-multithread --enable-dpdk 	enable DPDK input interfaces and packet wrapping (RTE_SDK and RTE_TARGET should be exported)
- --enable-openssl 				enables ssl* elements
- --enable-batch 				enables batch processing between elements (May need batcher and unbatcher elements in the graph)

To compile ClickNF run this command in its root directory:

make -j32

RUN
-----------------------

To run ClickNF run this command in its root directory:

sudo bin/click --dpdk -c0x01 -n10 --  conf/conf/bulk-server.click

in which -c and -n are DPDK parameters sets the number of cpus and memory channels respectively.

EXAMPLES
-----------------------

ClickNF applications using the TCP stack can be developed in two ways a)monolithic (everything inside a single module) b) modular by 
exploiting ClickNF's building blocks. In the conf folder we provide four examples to showcase ClickNF functionalities. 
The examples consists in:

- monolithic bulk transfer
- monolithic echo server
- modular echo server
- modular echo server with batching (configure with --enable-batch option )

All the examples below uses the test-tcp-layer2.click compound element that provide TCP stack to Click. Each element 
used in the configuration files has a number of parameters that can be used to change their behavior. Note that, to
run the experiments, you need to change at least IP and MAC addresses in the configurations provided. 

For some details about the usage of TCPEpollServer/Client building blocks used to develop modula apps, please read the modules' README in tcpepollserver.cc and tcpepollclient.cc .

Bulk transfer: 
------------------------

This example consists in transferring a big file from client to the server. 

First run the server with: 

sudo bin/click --dpdk -c0x1 -n10 -- conf/bulk-server.click

then run the client with:

sudo bin/click --dpdk -c0x1 -n10 -- conf/bulk-client.click

in which parameters inside --dpdk -- are dpdk parameters (-c0x1 COREMASK and -n10 MEMORY CHANNELS )

Echo server (monolithic):
-------------------------

This example consists in a server listening for incoming connections. Clients connect to the server, send one or more messages 
(depending on the client parameters) and wait for echo reply. When the message is received, the client resets the connection and 
repeat the same operation until the test is finished (the client is configured to connect a maximum number of times). 

First run the server with:

sudo bin/click --dpdk -c0x3 -n10 -- conf/echo-server-monolithic.click

then run the client with:

sudo bin/click --dpdk -c0xf -n10 -- conf/echo-client.click

Echo server (modular):
------------------------

The test is similar to the previous one with the exception that the echo server is implemented using two elements instead of 
implementing everithing inside a single element. 

First run the server with:

sudo bin/click --dpdk -c0x3 -n10 -- conf/echo-server-modular.click

then run the client with:

sudo bin/click --dpdk -c0xf -n10 -- conf/echo-client.click

Echo server (modular with batching):
------------------------------------

The test is similar to the previous one with the exception, when possible, echo server's elements transmit packet 
batches instead of single packets. Note that the code need to be recompiled configuring with --enable-batch option.

First run the server with:

sudo bin/click --dpdk -c0x3 -n10 -- conf/echo-server-modular-batch.click

then run the client with:

sudo bin/click --dpdk -c0xf -n10 -- conf/echo-client.click
